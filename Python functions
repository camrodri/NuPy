This is a short code with i am learning on how to code in python and i am learning functions.
But when iÂ´m going to debug this code warnings appears.
I am coding python 3 in Spyder.
This is the code:

def iva():    
    total=int(input('cuanto has gastado?'))
    num = int(input('que tipo de producto has comprado? 1) leche 2) pan 3) leche 4) huevos'))
    if num == 1:
        iv = 6
    elif num == 2:
        iv = 8
    elif num == 3:
        iv = 12
    else:
        iv = 16
iva1 = (total*iv/100)
print ('el impuesto de este producto es:')
print (iva1)
return iva1
iva()
print ('programa terminado')

Anybody knows what is going on?
